# Build ML Solutions with Scikit-Learn

Welcome to Build ML Solutions with Scikit-Learn! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to building machine learning solutions with Scikit-Learn, covering the main ML approaches—classification, regression, clustering, and more. It is organized into sections by task, each demonstrating core techniques, best practices, and advanced applications with hands-on examples.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders by machine learning task type:

```csharp
build-ML-solution-with-sklearn/
├── Bulid_Classification_Models/
├── Build_Regression_Models/
└── README.md
```
## Sections
### 1. [Classification Models](https://github.com/0xAgamy/Build_ML_Solutions_with_sklearn/tree/main/Bulid_Classification_Models)
#### Overview
This collection of notebooks walks through a variety of classification models and evaluation techniques, focusing on both traditional datasets (like Titanic) and image classification (Fashion MNIST). The goal is to provide a practical understanding of how to approach classification tasks, from data exploration to model comparison and hyperparameter optimization.

### 2. [Regression Models](https://github.com/0xAgamy/Build_ML_Solutions_with_sklearn/tree/main/Build_Regression_Models)
#### Overview
a series of Jupyter notebooks focused on building and evaluating regression models using the automobile and Exams. The notebooks cover a range of topics, from simple linear regression to more advanced techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and building multiple regression models. Each notebook contains structured sections for hands-on learning and model evaluation.
