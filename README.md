## Sections
### 1. [Classification Models](https://github.com/0xAgamy/Build_ML_Solutions_with_sklearn/tree/main/Bulid_Classification_Models)
#### Overview
This collection of notebooks walks through a variety of classification models and evaluation techniques, focusing on both traditional datasets (like Titanic) and image classification (Fashion MNIST). The goal is to provide a practical understanding of how to approach classification tasks, from data exploration to model comparison and hyperparameter optimization.

### 2. [Regression Models](https://github.com/0xAgamy/Build_ML_Solutions_with_sklearn/tree/main/Build_Regression_Models)
#### Overview
a series of Jupyter notebooks focused on building and evaluating regression models using the automobile and Exams. The notebooks cover a range of topics, from simple linear regression to more advanced techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and building multiple regression models. Each notebook contains structured sections for hands-on learning and model evaluation.

### 3. [Clustering Models](https://github.com/0xAgamy/Build_ML_Solutions_with_sklearn/tree/main/Build_Clustering_Models)
#### Overview
This project explores clustering techniques using both the Iris dataset and the MNIST 784 dataset. Through a series of Jupyter notebooks, we investigate various clustering algorithms, evaluate their performance, and fine-tune their hyperparameters. The project demonstrates practical applications of clustering, from simple models to more advanced approaches.

### 4. [Neural Networks Models](https://github.com/0xAgamy/Build_ML_Solutions_with_sklearn/tree/main/Build_Neural_Networks_Models)
#### Overview
This project demonstrates the power of neural networks in solving a variety of machine learning problems, including regression, classification, and dimensionality reduction. Through carefully crafted Jupyter notebooks, the project showcases practical implementations of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) on diverse datasets.
